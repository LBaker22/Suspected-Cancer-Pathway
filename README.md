# Suspected Cancer Pathway Data Explained.
This is a repository for the published SCPM data explained [View the PDF](./Docs/Data_Explained_SCPM.pdf) 

## Background
The Welsh Government Implemented a Suspected Cancer Pathway (SCP) in Wales from June 2019, with the purpose of setting a target for more rapid cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment provision, in addition to identifying areas within the pathway that requires additional support (Suspected Cancer Pathway, 2021).
Prior to its launch in 2019, the SCPM was split as urgent and non-urgent cancer pathways, and were designated as National Statistics (Welsh Government, 2023). As such the SCP-based cancer statistics are described as experimental, until a review in 2022 concluded that the methods were appropriate and the statistics were robust and reliable (Welsh Government, 2023).
The SCP is designed to retain all patients that have undergone investigative treatment which may or may not lead to a cancer diagnosis (Suspected Cancer Pathway, 2021), including patients identified with cancer and also those without. The data content involves all aspects about a suspected cancer patientsâ€™ journey pathway.

## Purpose
SCPM is a data source that can be analyzed via the SAIL Databank, however, its use is relatively low. This data explained aims to provide an overview of the SCPM datasource, showcase its contents and what it can be used for in Cancer Research.

## Data Structure
Markdown containing all SQL and R code used to generate insights published in the data explained.

## Funding
This project was funded by the Cancer Research Strategy for Wales (CReSt) catalytic funding (HCRW) and the Cancer Trusted Research Environment Project (Roche).
